## Why?
Students at Founders and Coders are encouraged to engage in what we call 20-20-20 which is a way to deal with problems when we get stuck. Spend 20 minutes on your own/in your pair working on a problem, when that time is up you ask members of your cohort to help you out for 20 minutes, and when that time is up you spend 20 minutes with a mentor trying to solve the problem.<br>My trouble is, I never do this, I never acknowledge when 20 minutes has passed, I want an app to help me do this!

## What?
A command line app written in node.js, which will give desktop notifications at 20 minute intervals to let you know when to ask your cohort members or mentors

## How?

I really don't know yet.

## Basic plan

* run a terminal command, something like "twenty --start" -> Get a desktop notification saying "timer started, good luck"
* After 20 minutes pass get a desktop notification saying "your twenty minutes is up! ask a cohort member"
* after another 20 minutes get a desktop notification saying "another twenty minutes is up! ask a mentor"
* after the final 20 minutes is up get a desktop notification saying "the whole of the 20/20/20 is up, the timer has been reset. Hoep you found a solution!"
* run "twenty --stop" to stop, get a notification saying "problem solved! good job"
